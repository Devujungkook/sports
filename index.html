						<p class="p_modal">Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players each on a field at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps.
							<br> <br>
							The game proceeds when a player on the fielding team, called the bowler, "bowls" (propels) the ball from one end of the pitch towards the wicket at the other end, with an "over" being completed once they have legally done so six times.
							<br> <br>
							The batting side has one player at each end of the pitch, with the player at the opposite end of the pitch from the bowler aiming to strike the ball with a bat.
							<br> <br>
							The batting side scores runs either when the ball reaches the boundary of the field, or when the two batters swap ends of the pitch, which results in one run.
							<br> <br>
							The fielding side's aim is to prevent run-scoring and dismiss each batter (so they are "out", and are said to have "lost their wicket"). 
							<br> <br>
							Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the bowled ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side either catching a hit ball before it touches the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease line in front of the wicket to complete a run.
							<br> <br> 
							When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches.

						<p class="p_modal">Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal.
							<br> <br>
							Unqualified, the word football normally means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is used. 
							<br> <br>
							Sports commonly called football include association football (known as soccer in North America and Oceania); gridiron football (specifically American football or Canadian football); Australian rules football; rugby union and rugby league; and Gaelic football.
							<br> <br>
							[1] These various forms of football share to varying extent common origins and are known as football codes.

						<p class="p_modal">Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net.
							<br> <br>
							Although it may be played with larger teams, the most common forms of the game are "singles" (with one player per side) and "doubles" (with two players per side). Badminton is often played as a casual outdoor activity in a yard or on a beach; formal games are played on a rectangular indoor court.
							<br> <br>
							Points are scored by striking the shuttlecock with the racquet and landing it within the opposing side's half of the court.
